# Patient Profile Picture Feature

## Overview
This feature allows patients to upload and display profile pictures in their profile page.

## Implementation Files
1. `accounts/templates/accounts/patient_profile.html` - Frontend template
2. `accounts/views.py` - Backend view logic
3. `accounts/models.py` - Uses existing UserProfile model (no changes needed)

## How to Test the Feature

### Prerequisites
1. Django development server running
2. User account with patient privileges
3. Login credentials for the patient account

### Testing Steps
1. Navigate to the Patient Profile page (`/accounts/patient/profile/`)
2. In the left sidebar, you should see:
   - Current profile picture (or default user icon)
   - "Profile Picture" label
   - File input field
   - "Upload Picture" button
3. Click "Choose File" and select an image file
4. Click "Upload Picture"
5. You should see a success message
6. The profile picture should now be displayed instead of the default icon

### Expected Behavior
- Profile picture displays in a circular format
- Default user icon shows when no profile picture is set
- Success message appears after upload
- Profile picture updates immediately after upload

## Feature Details

### Display Specifications

## Technical Notes

### Current Implementation
For demonstration purposes, the implementation uses a placeholder service. In production, you would integrate with a proper file storage system.

### Security Considerations
- CSRF protection enabled
- File type restrictions in place
- User authentication required

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Profile picture not updating**: Check server logs for errors
2. **Upload button not working**: Verify form enctype is set correctly
3. **File not accepted**: Ensure file is in supported format

### Debugging Steps
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify server response for upload requests
3. Confirm file permissions for storage directories
